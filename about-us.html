Three years earlier, in 1934, while still a department of Toyota Industries, it created its first product, the Type A engine, and, in 1936, its first passenger car, the Toyota AA. Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under 5 brands, including the Toyota brand, Hino, Lexus, Ranz, and Scion. It also holds a 51.2% stake in Daihatsu, a 16.66% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, a 5.9% stake in Isuzu, and a 0.27% stake in Tesla, as well as joint-ventures with two in China (GAC Toyota and Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor), one in India (Toyota Kirloskar), one in the Czech Republic (TPCA), along with several "nonautomotive" companies.[11] TMC is part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world.

<b>Toyota and the Environment</b>
<i>Personal mobility is important at Toyota.</i>

<p>It keeps people connected - with their work, their family and friends, and their communities. Making and driving cars, however, has an impact on the environment. Which is why we go to great lengths to minimise this impact throughout the entire lifecycle of our vehicles. We call this our 360-degree approach and it focuses predominantly on sustainability in design, production, logistics, sales, service and - at the end of the vehicle's useful life - recycling.</p>

<p>Our ultimate goal is to completely eliminate emissions and waste across every part of our business, and create a true zero emissions vehicle.</p>
